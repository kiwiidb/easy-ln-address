# Easy LN address with LNDhub.go

This code is meant to be hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), or another serverless platform.

[LNDhub.go](https://github.com/getalby/lndhub.go) supports unauthenticated invoice requests and `description_hash`, you only need your LNDhub username.
These endpoints should give you a fully functioning LN Address on your own domain that is backed by an LNDhub.go server such as https://ln.getalby.com.

LNURL Comments are supported, payer info is not.
